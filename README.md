# LinkedList in Python

- This is a simple implementation of a linked list in Python. A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are linked one after another, and each element is called a "node."

## Features

- Insertion of elements at the end of the list.
- Deletion of elements by value.
- Search for elements by value.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

- You can use this LinkedList class in your Python projects. Here is an example of how to create a linked list, add elements, delete elements, and search for elements:

# Import the LinkedList class
- from linkedlist import LinkedList

# Create a linked list
linked_list = LinkedList()

# Add elements
linked_list.append(1)
linked_list.append(2)
linked_list.append(3)

# Delete an element
linked_list.delete(2)

# Search for an element
result = linked_list.search(2)
print(result)  # Should print False
